The purpose of this file is to fully document the installation
procedure for VPython from source on Linux. Specific installers
for Windows and Mac are available at vpython.org. 

Windows and Mac builds are now special to them; 
see VCBuild/VCBuild.txt and MAC-OSX.txt.

I.  Prerequisites:
	Most or all of these may be provided by your operating system 
	distributor.  In every case, you must have the "developer" version
	of the packages to ensure that the required header files are 
	available.
	
	GNU g++ version 3.2.x or >= 3.3.1 (3.4.6 reccomended) (gcc.gnu.org).
	An implementation of OpenGL.
	The Boost C++ libraries
		
	Need Python 2.7.x (www.python.org), including
		the development (dev) package.
		
	From a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 this gets needed pieces:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install git
	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-2.4-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
	sudo apt-get install python-numpy
	sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev
	sudo apt-get install libboost-signals-dev
	sudo apt-get install tk

	(There is a helper script in src/gtk2 called apt-get-packages:

	sudo sh -v src/gtk2/apt-get-packages.sh

	that may be convenient for this)
		
	You need wxPython (wxpython.org). Currently one needs version 2.9, but
	on Linux you need to apply a patch before building wxPython. 
	Here is information about the patch:
	
	https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/wxpython-users/e27JioMs1fs
	
	In this forum post is a link to the patch, located at
	
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.9.4.0/wxPython-src-2.9.4.1.patch/download 

	Suppose you've unpacked the source package from wxpython.org into wxPython-src-2.9.4.0.
	Place the patch file in this directory (the directory that contains the README file), 
	cd to that directory, and execute this in a terminal:
	patch -p0 < wxPython-src-2.9.4.1.patch
	
	Next execute this:
	cd wxPython-src-2.9.4.0/wxPython
	sudo python2.7 build-wxpython.py --build_dir=../bld

	If you specify --install in this build, sometimes the build/install fails in odd ways.
	So it seems safer to just build without installing, then point to the build files.
	
	At the conclusion of the build you will see something like the following:
	 To use wxPython you may need to execute these statements:
	   export PYTHONPATH="/home/bruce/Downloads/wxPython-src-2.9.4.0/wxPython"
	   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/bruce/Downloads/wxPython-src-2.9.4.0/bld/lib"

	Now you are ready to build VPython. In the VPython repository directory execute
	sudo python2.7 setup.py install
	
	(You'll need Python modules Polygon, FontTools, and ttfquery, from pypi.python.org.
	The setup.py script will attempt to build/install these if they are not
	present, but sometimes it can't find them. If that happens, download the
	source for each module, unpack and in a terminal cd to the module folder.
	Execute "sudo python setup.py install" to build and install the module.)

	Create a file "vidle.sh" containing three statements like the following
	(see the final output of the build), execute "chmod a=rwx vidle.sh" to make
	the file executable, then doubleclick the file to start the VIDLE editor:

	export PYTHONPATH="/home/bruce/Downloads/wxPython-src-2.9.4.0/wxPython"
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/bruce/Downloads/wxPython-src-2.9.4.0/bld/lib"
	python2.7 /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/VPython-6.03-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/vidle/idle.py

	Alternatively you could place the export statements in your .profile or .bashrc files
	in which case you wouldn't need them in vidle.sh.


II:   Troubleshooting

	From a typescript, the following will print all VPYTHON_NOTEs:
	env VPYTHON_DEBUG=1 python test.py
