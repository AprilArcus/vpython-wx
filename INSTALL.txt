The purpose of this file is to fully document the installation
procedure for VPython from source on Linux. Specific installers
for Windows and Mac are available at vpython.org. 

Windows and Mac builds are now special to them; 
see VCBuild/VCBuild.txt and MAC-OSX.txt.

I.  Prerequisites:
	Most or all of these may be provided by your operating system 
	distributor.  In every case, you must have the "developer" version
	of the packages to ensure that the required header files are 
	available.
	
	GNU g++ version 3.2.x or >= 3.3.1 (3.4.6 reccomended) (gcc.gnu.org).
	An implementation of OpenGL.
	The Boost C++ libraries
		
	Need Python 2.2.x or 2.3.x or 2.4.x or 2.5.x (www.python.org), including
		the development (dev) package.
	Need Python modules Polygon, FontTools, and ttfquery, from pypi.python.org.
	   For each module, unpack and in a terminal cd to the module folder.
	   Execute "sudo python setup.py install" to build and install the module.
	Need numpy (numpy.sourceforge.net).
		
	From a fresh Ubuntu 12.10 this gets needed pieces:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install git
	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-2.4-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
	sudo apt-get install python-numpy
	sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev
	sudo apt-get install libboost-signals-dev
		
	You need wxPython (wxpython.org). Currently one needs version 2.9, but
	on Linux you need to apply a patch. Here is information about the patch:
	
	https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/wxpython-users/e27JioMs1fs
	
	In this forum post is a link to the patch, located at
	
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.9.4.0/wxPython-src-2.9.4.1.patch/download 
	
	Place the patch file in the wxPython directory, cd to that directory,
	and execute this in a terminal:
	patch -p0 < wxPython-src-2.9.4.1.patch
	
	Also, in build/tools/build-wxwidgets.py, Steve had to
	change line 267 from "--enable-mediactrl" to #"--enable-mediactrl"
	for lack of GStreaming.
	
	Next cd wxPython (within the wxPython package) and execute
	sudo python2.7 build-wxpython.py --build_dir=../bld --install

	Finally, in the repository directory execute this: sudo python2.7 install
	

II:   Troubleshooting

	From a typescript, the following will print all VPYTHON_NOTEs:
	env VPYTHON_DEBUG=1 python test.py
